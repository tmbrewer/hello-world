Unique approaches to fundamentals of coding

This project was innitially named "unique appraoches to fundamentals of design" because I love architecture and design and am learning to code as a way of creating and assimilating a database of design projects I would like to see realized in the real world, or a reference to design projects already in existence which I would like to add my own changes to.

Perhaps no one will read this or appreciate what I am creating, but as Goethe once said, "What ever you do or dream you can do - begin it! Boldness has genius, power, and something supernatural in it." So I am taking these words to heart and starting today, the course of my entire life is changing. I will finish what I start, and I will create beautiful things beyond my own comprehension now. :^) 

That's all. :^) Thanks for stopping bye.
